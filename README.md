# Sewa Room Apartemen

## Project Overview

Sewa Room Apartemen is a web application for renting rooms in apartments. The application allows users to view available rooms, register for an account, log in, book rooms, and manage their bookings. Users can also make payments via COD (Cash on Delivery) or via bank transfer.

## Installation

To install the Sewa Room Apartemen application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sewa-room-apartemen
   ```

2. **Set up a database**:
   Create a MySQL database named `apartment_rental` and execute the necessary SQL commands to create the required tables (not provided in the project files).

3. **Configure database connection**:
   Edit the `config.php` file to set your database credentials:
   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db   = 'apartment_rental'; // Your database name
   $user = 'root'; // Your database username
   $pass = ''; // Your database password
   ```

4. **Install dependencies** (if necessary):
   Make sure to have PHP installed. This project doesn't require additional PHP packages. If you want to use Tailwind CSS, you can include it using a CDN as shown in the project files.
